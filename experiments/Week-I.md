# Week I – Training Week

### Objective:
To gain hands-on training on identifying, cutting, and cleaning ITO-coated glass substrates, which are commonly used as bottom electrodes in thin-film devices. This week’s focus was on mastering:

- Identification of ITO-coated surfaces  
- Proper cutting technique  
- Systematic substrate cleaning  
- Cleaning and preparation of glassware (beaker) for sonication

## 1. 🔍 Identifying the ITO-coated Side of Glass Substrates

**Substrate:** Glass slides with one side coated with **ITO (Indium Tin Oxide)**.

### 🔹What is ITO?

ITO is a transparent conductive oxide — a solid solution of **In₂O₃ (indium oxide)** and **SnO₂ (tin oxide)**. It combines **optical transparency** with **electrical conductivity**, making it ideal for use as a **bottom electrode** in devices like RRAM, OLEDs, and solar cells.

- **Why ITO?**
  - Transparent: Allows optical access in optoelectronic devices.  
  - Conductive: Enables charge injection or collection.  
  - Smooth and uniform: Excellent substrate for thin film deposition.

### 🔹How to Identify ITO Side?

To identify which side is ITO-coated:

> 🧪 **Tool Used:** Multimeter with continuity buzzer  
> 📸 *[Insert image here: Multimeter with probes touching ITO and glass sides]*

- Touch the two probes of the multimeter to one surface.
  - **If it buzzes** → That’s the **ITO side** (conductive).  
  - **If it remains silent** → That’s the **glass side** (insulating).

## 2. ✂️ Cutting the ITO Glass into 1.5 × 1.5 cm Samples

### 🔹Tool Used: Diamond Scribe Pen

A handheld tool tipped with industrial diamond used to score glass.

- **Why use diamond scribe?**  
  Diamond's hardness allows precise scoring of the brittle ITO-coated glass without shattering it.

### 🔹Cutting Procedure:

1. Place the ITO glass on a clean, stable surface with **ITO side facing downward**.  
2. Use a **ruler and diamond scribe** to mark and score lines 1.5 cm apart.  
3. Snap the glass along the score lines to produce **1.5 × 1.5 cm samples**.

## 3. 🧼 Pre-Cleaning Sample Handling

Before cleaning, the samples must be placed in a **petri dish**:

- Line the dish with **butter paper** (wiped with **IPA**).  
- **Place the samples with ITO side facing up** (to avoid scratching it).  
- Handle samples only with tweezers to avoid contamination from hands.

## 4. 🧽 Cleaning of Glassware (Beaker) for Sonication

Before placing samples for ultrasonic cleaning, the **beaker** must be properly cleaned.

### 🔹Beaker Cleaning Steps:

1. Wash thoroughly with **tap water** to remove gross contamination.  
2. Apply **BIM dishwashing liquid**, scrub gently, rinse with tap water.  
3. Rinse well with **DI water** to eliminate soap residues.  
4. Perform a rinse with **acetone** to remove organic residues.  
5. Wipe outside with **tissue paper**.  
6. **Dry in oven** for a few minutes at ~60–80°C.

**Why this sequence?**  
Each step targets specific types of contaminants:

- Tap water → Physical debris  
- Soap → Oils & particles  
- DI water → Ionic contaminants  
- Acetone → Organic residues  
- Oven drying → Removes moisture

## 5. 🧫 Cleaning of ITO Samples Using Ultrasonic Bath

> 📸 *[Insert image here: Ultrasonic bath with labeled solvents]*

**Ultrasonication Time:** 5 minutes per solvent  
**Why Sonicate?** Ultrasonic waves create cavitation bubbles in liquid, dislodging particles and contaminants from the sample surface.

### 🔹Step 1: IPA (Isopropyl Alcohol) – 5 mins

- **Purpose:** Removes light organic contaminants like oils or residues from handling.

### 🔹Step 2: Acetone – 5 mins

- **Purpose:** Dissolves stubborn organic impurities and any residual adhesives or photoresists.

### 🔹Step 3: Alconox Solution – 5 mins

- **What is it?** A laboratory detergent used to remove fine particulate and greasy contamination.  
- **Preparation:**
  - Weigh **0.4 g** of **Alconox powder**.  
  - Add to **40 mL of DI water** in a clean bottle or beaker.  
  - Shake or stir until fully dissolved.  
- **Purpose:** Deep-cleaning step to remove inorganic salts, dust, or other residues.

### 🔹Step 4: DI Water – 5 mins

- **Purpose:** Final rinse to remove any remaining chemicals or residues from previous steps.

## 6. 🌬️ Drying the Samples

After cleaning, samples are dried using a **Nitrogen (N₂) gas dryer**.

> 📸 *[Insert image here: N₂ gas gun in use]*

- Blow dry gently with **N₂ gas** while keeping the ITO side up.  
- Avoid touching the surface — handle only with clean tweezers.

**Why N₂ drying?**

- Nitrogen is inert → does not oxidize the surface.  
- Prevents water marks or stains from DI water drying.
