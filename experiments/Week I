# 🧪 Week I: Training

## Objective

To learn the foundational procedures for fabricating RRAM devices on ITO-coated glass substrates, including identifying ITO-coated surfaces, cutting and cleaning the substrates, and preparing them for further processing. This was done to familiarize with techniques applicable to future work on expensive platinumised silicon substrates.

## 1. 🔍 Identifying the ITO-Coated Side of Glass

**Material Used**:

- Glass slides with one side coated with **ITO (Indium Tin Oxide)**

**Method**:

We used a **multimeter** in continuity mode to distinguish between the ITO-coated side and the plain glass side.

> **Procedure**:
>
> - Touch the two multimeter probes on the **same surface**.
> - **Beep sound** confirms electrical conductivity — **ITO side**.
> - **No beep** implies insulating surface — **glass side**.

**🧠 Why?**

ITO is a **transparent conductive oxide**, commonly used as an electrode in optoelectronic and memory devices. The **conductivity** of ITO allows it to be distinguished from glass using a multimeter, which detects electrical continuity.

**🧾 About ITO**:

Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is a mixture of indium oxide (In₂O₃) and tin oxide (SnO₂). It is:

- **Optically transparent**
- **Electrically conductive**
- Used extensively in displays, solar cells, and **RRAM** as a bottom electrode due to its excellent **charge injection** capability and compatibility with thin-film oxides.

## 2. ✂️ Cutting the ITO Substrate

After identifying the ITO side, the glass slides were cut into **1.5 cm × 1.5 cm** squares using a **diamond scribe pen**.

> **Procedure**:
>
> - Place the slide **ITO-side down** on a clean surface.
> - Use a **diamond scriber** to score the glass.
> - Break along the scored line to obtain uniform squares.

**🧠 Why ITO-side down during cutting?**

To **prevent scratching or damaging** the conductive surface. Keeping the ITO side in contact with a soft surface minimizes abrasion.

## 3. 🍽️ Sample Placement in Petri Dish for Cleaning

**Setup**:

- Line the petri dish with **butter paper** (wiped with IPA).
- Place cut samples **ITO side up**, resting on the butter paper.

**🧠 Why ITO-side up?**

To avoid **contaminating or scratching** the conductive ITO surface during cleaning. Keeping the active surface exposed also ensures efficient contact with cleaning agents.

## 4. 🧼 Cleaning the Weaker (Glass Container for Sonication)

Before using it for sample cleaning in the ultrasonic bath, the **weaker** must be free from contaminants.

> **Cleaning Steps**:
>
> 1. Rinse with tap water.
> 2. Wash using **BIM dishwashing liquid**.
> 3. Rinse again with tap water.
> 4. Rinse with **Deionized (DI) water**.
> 5. Final rinse with **acetone**.
> 6. Dry in **oven** for a few minutes.
> 7. Use tissue paper to clean the outer surface before oven drying.

**🧠 Why this sequence?**

- Tap water + BIM removes **grease or dirt**.
- DI water ensures **ionic purity**, avoiding mineral residue.
- Acetone removes **organic contaminants** and dries quickly.
- Oven drying eliminates **residual moisture**.

## 5. 🧴 Cleaning the ITO Samples (Sonication Process)

Using an **ultrasonic cleaner** (sonicator), each sample is cleaned in 4 consecutive steps, **5 minutes each**.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Cleaning with Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA)

> Immerse samples in a beaker filled with IPA and sonicate for 5 minutes.

**🧠 Why?**  
IPA dissolves **organic residues and oils** on the surface. Sonication enhances penetration of the solvent into microfeatures, increasing cleaning efficiency.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Repeat IPA Sonication (5 min)

> A second IPA wash ensures **complete removal** of stubborn contaminants.

**🧠 Why twice?**  
Redundant cleaning increases **reliability**, especially before thin-film processing.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Alconox Solution Sonication (5 min)

> Prepare the Alconox solution:
>
> - Weigh **0.4 g of Alconox powder**
> - Dissolve in **40 mL of DI water**
> - Shake well  
>
> Then sonicate the samples in this solution.

**🧠 Why Alconox?**  
Alconox is a **laboratory-grade detergent**. It removes **ionic, particulate, and biological contaminants** that IPA may miss.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: DI Water Sonication (5 min)

> Final sonication in pure DI water to **remove detergent residues**.

**🧠 Why?**  
Ensures that **no ionic or detergent** contaminants are left on the surface.

---

## 6. 💨 Drying the Cleaned Samples

After sonication, samples are dried using a **high-purity nitrogen gas dryer (N₂ gun)**.

**🧠 Why Nitrogen?**

- Prevents **oxidation**
- Leaves **no water spots** (as nitrogen is dry and inert)
- Maintains surface cleanliness

**📷 Insert Image Suggestion**:
- Nitrogen dryer or gas nozzle
